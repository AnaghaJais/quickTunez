# quickTunez


Quick  tunez  is a real-time, multiplayer game where people race against one another to guess the name of songs that are played. I used Spotify API, socket.io,node.js Express.js, MySQL Database technologies to have a fun, competitive, and hopefully addicting game involving correctly guessing song titles from small clips as fast as you can against others in your multiplayer room https://quicktunez.herokuapp.com/
